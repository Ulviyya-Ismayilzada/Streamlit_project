Structurally, we have created a web application with three pages long. We
have 2 different datas that contains Water Portability and Long prediction datas.
Pages are assembled accordingly:
1. The first page (i.e. homepage) is used to introduce ourselves with the data.
2. The second page the EDA is used to data imputation deletion, imbalance
checking, cleaning data from outliers and at last, this page should also be included
some visuals for the data;
3. The final page, the modeling page includes preprocessing, variety of scalers,
variety of encoders, train test splitting distribution, building of the model, calculations
for evaluation metrics and some visualization.
